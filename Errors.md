## Error: Every Derived Table Must Have Its Own Alias

This error occurs when a derived table (or subquery in the FROM clause) in SQL does not have an alias. An alias is a temporary name given to a table or column for the purpose of a particular SQL query.

### Solution

You can resolve this error by adding an alias at the end of the subquery. Here's the corrected version of your query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary 
    FROM employee 
    ORDER BY salary DESC 
    LIMIT 2
) AS derived_table_alias
ORDER BY salary 
LIMIT 1;
```

In this corrected query, `derived_table_alias` is the alias given to the derived table. You can replace `derived_table_alias` with any name you prefer. This should resolve the error you're encountering. Remember, the alias is only temporary and is used just for the purpose of this query. It does not affect the names of the tables in your database.
